# B822：翻译+适当修改-异质性分析：6 种方法对比与 R 语言实现

Bull, H., & Ketz, P. (2023). Lab 3: Estimating Heterogenous Treatment Effects. Semester 2, 2022/23. Retrieved from https://ml-in-econ.appspot.com/lab3.html

We discuss and implement 6 different methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects:

-   OLS with interaction terms
-   Post-selection Lasso
-   Causal Trees
-   Causal Forests

We compare the heterogeneity identified by each of these methods. We compare the CATE of each of these methods.

Finally, we compute the Best Linear Predictor (BLP) and the Sorted Group Average Treatment Effects (GATES).
