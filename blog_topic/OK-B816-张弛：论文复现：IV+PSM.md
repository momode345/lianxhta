- Standard two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression remains dominant in instrumental variables estimation of causal effects even though the literature has shown that 2SLS may be inconsistent when effects are heterogenous and the instrument is only valid when conditioning on covariates. To show that this is not merely a hypothetical threat, this paper re-estimates the returns to college using college proximity as an instrument based on the data from Card (Aspects of labour market behavior: essays in honour of John Vanderkamp, University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1995). The results show that 2SLS yields systematically larger estimates of the returns to college than more flexible estimators based on the instrument propensity score. In the full sample, differences amount to about 50 to 100%. This is due to the implicit conditional-variance weighting performed by 2SLS. Moreover, in line with the theoretical prediction by Sloczynski (When should we (not) interpret linear IV estimands as LATE? IZA discussion papers 14349, Institute of Labor Economics (IZA), 2021), findings suggest that the impact of the conditional-variance weighting is larger when instrument groups are not roughly the same size. Thus, it is advised to use 2SLS with caution and use estimators based on the instrument propensity score instead when groups are of different size and covariates are predictive of the instrument.
- By re-examining the Card ([1995](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-023-02441-7#ref-CR11 "Card D (1995) Using geographic variation in college proximity to estimate the return to schooling. In: Christophides LN, Grant EK, Swidinsky R (eds) Aspects of labour market behavior: essays in Honour of John Vanderkamp. University of Toronto Press, Toronto, pp 201--222")) data on college proximity and the returns to college, this paper shows that potential inconsistencies in 2SLS estimates of local treatment effects documented in the theoretical literature are not merely a hypothetical threat when effects are heterogenous. For the data at hand, 2SLS yields systematically larger effects than more flexible estimators based on the PS with differences amounting to roughly 50 to 100%. It is shown that this is because standard linear-in-covariates 2SLS yields a conditional variance-weighted average effect, putting more weight on units with a PS close to a coin flip. In line with theoretical predictions by Sloczynski ([2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-023-02441-7#ref-CR31 "Sloczynski T (2021) When should we (not) interpret linear IV estimands as LATE? IZA discussion papers 14349, Institute of Labor Economics (IZA)")), the results suggest that 2SLS estimates can be expected to be more trustworthy when sample shares of instrument groups are roughly of equal size. Moreover, the paper shows that this is because the effects of conditional-variance weighting tend to be less severe when groups sizes are similar. Overall, the results show that the presumption that 2SLS yields point estimates close to more flexible estimators based on the PS as argued by Angrist and Pischke ([2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-023-02441-7#ref-CR5 "Angrist JD, Pischke JS (2008) Mostly harmless econometrics. Princeton UUniversity Press, Princeton")) does not apply in general and that one should be suspicious of 2SLS estimates when group sizes differ substantially and covariates are predictive of the instrument. In that case it may be best to use semi- or non-parametric estimation techniques instead. At the very least, one should use these methods to assess the sensitivity of estimates regarding implicit parametric assumptions made when using linear-in-covariates 2SLS.
